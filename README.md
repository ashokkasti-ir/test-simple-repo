# test-simple-repo

A minimal repository with a manually triggered GitHub Actions workflow.

## Getting Started
- Clone this repository.
- Make changes, commit, and push as usual.

## GitHub Actions: Manual Workflow
A workflow is defined at [.github/workflows/manual.yml](cci:7://file:///Users/ashokkasti/Projects/Playground/test-simple-repo/.github/workflows/manual.yml:0:0-0:0).

To trigger it manually:
1. Go to your repository on GitHub.
2. Open the “Actions” tab.
3. Select “Manual Run”.
4. Click “Run workflow”.

## Notes
- The workflow checks out the repo and echoes a timestamped message.
- You can extend it with additional steps as needed.
